This document contains filesizes for the compressed files so I can 
identify the buffer size for the Exomized files we load from disk.

Max compressed animation filesize: $2000 -> $2A1B [$1000]
Uncompressed animation filesize: $2000 -> $3900 [$1900]

Memory map:
$0800         : BASIC start
$0ff0 - $3000 : Music Buffer
$3000 - $5000 : Petscii Buffer
$5000 - $C000 : Code
$C000 - $D000 : Load Buffer
